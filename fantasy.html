      <h2>The Dragon's Wish</h2>
      <p>
        In the kingdom of Eldoria, dragons once ruled the skies until they vanished a century ago. One day, a poor farmer named Linan discovered a glowing egg in a cave near the Northern Ridge.<br><br>
        The egg hatched into a baby dragon, silver-scaled and curious. It spoke in dreams, revealing its name: Syrel. As Linan raised Syrel, he learned that the dragon could grant a single wish ‚Äî not gold, not power, but a change of destiny.<br><br>
        War brewed in Eldoria. Linan‚Äôs village was marked for destruction. In desperation, he whispered his wish: ‚ÄúLet peace take root.‚Äù<br><br>
        Syrel soared into the sky and roared with light. The battlefield froze. Soldiers dropped their weapons. Even the king fell to his knees in tears.<br><br>
        Syrel turned to stone atop the mountain, his wish fulfilled. To this day, Eldoria knows peace, and the stone dragon watches silently.

      <h2>The Portal Tree</h2>
      <p>
        Deep within the Forest of Echoes stood a tree taller than any castle tower. Its leaves shimmered like stars. Locals feared it, saying it sang at night. But young Mira, a curious girl with mismatched eyes, believed the legends.<br><br>
        On her twelfth birthday, she climbed it. The tree opened ‚Äî revealing a swirling portal. Mira stepped through and found a mirror-world, where her fears took shape. Shadows chased her, mimicking her every move.<br><br>
        To return, she had to face her worst memory ‚Äî the fire that took her parents. With courage, she walked through the flame-shadow. It turned to light.<br><br>
        The portal closed. Mira was never the same. She became a healer, helping others face pain with strength ‚Äî for she knew what it meant to conquer fear in a world of magic.

      <h2>Wings of the Wind</h2>
      <p>
        In Zephyria, a city that floated in the clouds, everyone was born with wings‚Äîexcept Alaric. He walked while others soared. But Alaric dreamed bigger than any flyer.<br><br>
        He built mechanical wings from feathers, wires, and willpower. People laughed. But one day, a storm tore through the city and grounded every winged citizen.<br><br>
        Except Alaric. His machine wings sliced through the gale. He rescued dozens, carried medicine, and lit hope in their eyes.<br><br>
        After the storm, the Council of Sky crowned him ‚ÄúWind‚Äôs Heir.‚Äù Alaric proved: even if you're born without wings, your spirit can still fly.
