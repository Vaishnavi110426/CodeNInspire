      <h2>The Honest Woodcutter</h2>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, a poor woodcutter accidentally dropped his axe into a river. Sitting beside the water, he wept, as it was the only tool he owned.<br><br>

        Suddenly, a divine figure appeared and dove into the water, emerging with a golden axe. ‚ÄúIs this yours?‚Äù she asked.<br><br>

        The woodcutter shook his head, ‚ÄúNo, mine was old and made of iron.‚Äù She smiled and returned with a silver axe. Again, he refused. Finally, she brought up his old iron axe. ‚ÄúThat one!‚Äù he cried.<br><br>

        Impressed by his honesty, she gifted him all three axes. His honesty changed his life‚Äîand taught the village that integrity always brings unexpected rewards.

      <h2>The Boy and the Starfish</h2>
      <p>
        A man walking along a beach noticed a boy throwing starfish into the sea. ‚ÄúWhy are you doing that?‚Äù he asked.<br><br>

        ‚ÄúThe tide is going out. If I don‚Äôt throw them back, they‚Äôll die,‚Äù the boy replied.<br><br>

        The man looked around. ‚ÄúBut there are thousands! You can‚Äôt possibly make a difference.‚Äù<br><br>

        The boy picked up another starfish, gently tossed it into the waves, and smiled, ‚ÄúI made a difference to that one.‚Äù<br><br>

        That day, the man joined him. Small acts can create big change.

      <h2>The Empty Pot</h2>
      <p>
        An emperor once declared he would choose his successor by a simple test. He gave every child a seed and said, ‚ÄúReturn in one year with your plant.‚Äù<br><br>

        Ping, a kind-hearted boy, nurtured his pot every day, but nothing grew. When he returned a year later, his pot was still empty. Others had large, beautiful plants.<br><br>

        The emperor smiled at Ping. ‚ÄúAll seeds I gave were boiled. They couldn‚Äôt grow. You were the only one honest enough to return with an empty pot.‚Äù<br><br>

        Ping became emperor, proving truthfulness blooms brighter than deceit.
