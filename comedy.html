      <h2>The Lazy Genius</h2>
      <p>
        Ravi was the laziest boy in his school, but oddly enough, he was also the smartest. While others worked hard, Ravi worked smart‚Ä¶ or avoided work entirely.<br><br>
        During a school exam, instead of writing answers, he drew a fake snake on his answer sheet. When asked why, he replied, ‚ÄúI wanted to scare the questions away.‚Äù The principal gave him detention‚Ä¶ but also laughed.<br><br>
        When a new teacher challenged him to solve a puzzle, Ravi solved it by simply rearranging the question instead of the answer.<br><br>
        One day, he invented a machine that flipped the TV remote for him without lifting his arm. That invention won a science fair and landed him an internship at a tech firm.<br><br>
        They say Ravi might rule the world someday‚Ä¶ but only if someone brings him the throne.

      <h2>The Talking Mirror</h2>
      <p>
        Neha bought a mirror from a quirky antique shop. The old shopkeeper warned, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs honest. Brutally honest.‚Äù She laughed it off.<br><br>
        The next morning, the mirror said, ‚ÄúYou slept with your mouth open again. A mosquito almost moved in.‚Äù<br><br>
        She was stunned. Every day, it commented: ‚ÄúMismatched socks today? Bold choice.‚Äù or ‚ÄúThird snack in an hour? Impressive dedication.‚Äù<br><br>
        One day, she snapped and shouted, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you be NICE?‚Äù The mirror replied, ‚ÄúI reflect you. Be nice to yourself first.‚Äù<br><br>
        Neha learned to laugh at herself, wear those crazy socks proudly, and eventually... gave the mirror its own podcast. It now has 2 million followers.

      <h2>Operation Mango</h2>
      <p>
        Bunty and Chiku, two schoolboys, had one summer goal: steal mangoes from the Principal's giant backyard tree.<br><br>
        They crafted a master plan‚Äîcodenamed Operation Mango. Bunty distracted the neighbor‚Äôs dog with samosas, while Chiku tried to climb using a rope made of socks.<br><br>
        Midway up, the socks snapped, and Chiku landed in a puddle. Bunty panicked and rang the bell of the principal's gate ‚Äî then ran.<br><br>
        Principal Sharma found Chiku drenched and holding a half-eaten samosa. Instead of scolding, he laughed and handed them two ripe mangoes.<br><br>
        ‚ÄúNext time,‚Äù he said, ‚Äújust ask. And bring more samosas.‚Äù
